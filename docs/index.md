# Getting Started

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/rui-next)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rui-next) <a href="https://nikoni.top/rui-next/docs/" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=docs%20%26%20demos&color=3366cc" alt="docs & demos" /></a>

## Overview

Thanks to [`vitepress-rc`](https://github.com/cvnine/vitepress-rc) that could support `React docs+demos` well to run with `vitepress+vite`. I tried [`dumi`](https://d.umijs.org/) but it is coupled with webpack, and tried [`vuepress 2`](https://github.com/vuepress/vuepress-next) with `vite bundler` but it seems not good enough to support `React demo`. For now, it seems `vitepress-rc` could meet my personal requirement for `React docs+demos` + `vitepress+vite`.
